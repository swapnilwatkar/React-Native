# React-Native-App
Sample React-Native app


This app uses React Navigation also known as stack navigator to manage the navigation history and presentation of the appropriate screen based on the route taken by a user inside the app. Only one screen is presented to a user at a given time.

Install Expo by running this: 
npm install -g expo-cli 
On Mac, try running it this way: 
sudo npm install --unsafe-perm -g expo-cli
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
npm install expo install expo-linear-gradient
npm start

you can replace images you want.
