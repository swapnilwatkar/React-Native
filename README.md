# React-Native-App
Sample React-Native app


This app uses React Navigation also known as stack navigator to manage the navigation history and presentation of the appropriate screen based on the route taken by a user inside the app. Only one screen is presented to a user at a given time.

npm install -g expo-cli 
On Mac, try running it this way:
